<h1>Snow Removal Workflow</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The snow removal workflow is a live process and collects valuable data throughout the snow removal process. The data is 
used to make critical business decisions concerning vehicle maintenance, scheduling, routes, salt and sand 
acquisition, and payroll.</br>

</br>The workflow begins with the field worker filling out a digital form, in which information and data about plow Unit Number,
mileage, and sand and salt loaded are collected. After the form is filled out, the field worker uses a link on the form to navigate 
from the form to the Snow Removal QuickCapture application.</br>

The QuickCapture app collects data about plow routes. 
When the plow drops to push snow, the app collets when, where, and how far. The app also collects when, where, how long, 
and for how far salt or sand is used. Finally, the field worker can use the app to indicate the location of obstuctions along the plow routes. </br>

On the backend, in real-time, all the collected data is being added to a feature-layer. Also in real-time, through the use of a dashboard, 
the feature layer is used to present the data in a understandable format.

<h2>Skills</h2>
This workflow demonstrates proficient and skilled use of Project Management, knowledge of business processes, HTML,
application design, and electronic form design.
